# Sphere raycasting in CUDA

## Goal

There are beams sent from the userâ€™s eye perpendicularly to the screen, one beam goes
through one pixel. Color of the pixel must be calculated when the beam hits the
closest sphere (you may create a z-buffer). At the hit point hit angle can be easily
calculated having the sphere position and radius.
Phong reflection model is described for example here:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phong_reflection_model. In raycasting viewer
direction vector is parallel to Z axis.

Input: Random set of colored spheres (at least 1k) and color sources of light in 3d
space (at least 10).

Output: Graphics displayed in a window, user can rotate the scene or lights.

## Prerequisites
- Windows (recommended version >= 10)
- [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit) (recommended version >= 12)

### Optional
- [GnuWin](https://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/install.html) (if you are crazy enough to use `make` on Windows)

## Usage

### Microsoft Visual Studio
1. Open project solution `sphere-raycasting.sln`
2. Add `lib/freeglut.lib` as an additional dependency:
    - Open `Project->Properties`;
    - Open `Linker->Additional Library Directories` and add `lib`;
    - Open `Linker->Input->Additional Dependencies` and add `freeglut.lib`.
3. Start without debugging (`Ctrl+F5`). Note: Use only `Release` version, otherwise the program will run very slow.

### Makefile
1. Open project folder in the command prompt
2. Build the project:
```
$ make
```
3. Run the project:
```
$ main.exe
```
